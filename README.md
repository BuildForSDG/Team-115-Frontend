## About

What is this project about. Ok to enrich here or the section above it with an image. 
This project is about getting African governments, organizations and employeers to embrace and adopt technology which will help in increasing their throughput, lead to an unimaginable economic growth, and accelerated development of the continent. 

## Why
Technology Adoption Advisory Web Application [TAAWA], solves the problems faced by organizations, employers and government entities in process automation and transaction restrictions due to geographical limitations. 
It addresses the 9th of the SDG goals **Industry, Infrastructure and Innovation** and is key to achieving **Smart City** status by African cities.
It is important for African governments, employers and organizations to adopt technology in their day to day activities if they are to stand on equal footings with and/or exceed their international counterparts. 
This project aims to enlighten the above named entities on the available technologies that could lead to a potential growth and improved efficiency of operations and ultimately profit in their various organizations. It also provides advisory services in the technology adoption process with up-to-date contact information of the various makers and an option for technical assistance.
